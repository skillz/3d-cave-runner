# 3D Cave Runner - Unity-Android Example Project

This repo contains an example of the 3D Cave Runner game with Skillz integration. The purpose of this example is to show how to integrate an Unity-Android game with the Skillz Platform .

This project is setup to work with the latest version of the Skillz Android SDK, which can be found at https://skillz.com/developer/downloads. Once the SDK is downloaded, the Skillz embedded framework will need to be added to the project.

The Installation for this project was divided into 3 major steps: [Installing the Skillz framework](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/2aee1731dd00f1024a05bdde5d8f5dc890561a40),[Implementing Core Skillz](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/0ac92e3967b80cab478dd27aadb8c614359f9b44), and [Implementing Skillz Fairness](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/23c44742d352a415916e7cbb4a3fad29446ce517).

### Skillz example instructions <br />
Step 1: This [commit](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/2aee1731dd00f1024a05bdde5d8f5dc890561a40) completed the [Installing the Skillz framework ](https://cdn.skillz.com/doc/developer/unity/android/integrate_skillz_sdk/install_framework/) step of the Skillz Integration.

* This step adds the framework to the project and configures the project to link with the Skillz framework.<br /><br />
